# LinkedIn Post - Plaza WhatsApp Widget Launch

---

🚀 **We just open-sourced our first developer tool, and we're pretty excited about it.**

A few months ago, we needed something simple: add a WhatsApp button to our real estate client websites.

"Easy," we thought. "Probably a one-liner."

Spoiler: Most solutions were anything but simple.

We found widgets that:
- Required jQuery (in 2025!) 💀
- Needed 5+ files to integrate
- Weighed 50KB+ for a floating button
- Broke on Brazilian Portuguese characters (ã, ç, õ... you know the drill 🇧🇷)

So we did what engineers do: **we built our own.**

## **Introducing Plaza WhatsApp Widget**

A truly plug-and-play WhatsApp button for any website. One script tag. Zero dependencies. 2KB gzipped.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/plazatechnologies/whatsapp-widget@1/dist/whatsapp-widget.min.js"
        data-whatsapp-phone="5511999999999"
        data-whatsapp-message="Hi! I'm interested"></script>
```

That's it. No npm install. No build step. No jQuery. Just paste and go.

## **Why this matters to developers:**

✅ **CDN-first design** → Served from 100+ edge locations via jsDelivr
✅ **Semantic versioning** → Pin to @1 for auto-updates, or lock to @1.0.0 for stability
✅ **Zero dependencies** → Pure vanilla JavaScript that just works
✅ **Battle-tested** → Handles Brazilian Portuguese encoding (because we learned the hard way)
✅ **Lightweight** → 2KB gzipped. Your users won't even notice it loading
✅ **Customizable** → Position, colors, tooltips, message placeholders... all configurable

## **The open source mindset**

Here's the thing: We didn't build this to sell licenses or gate features behind paywalls.

We built it because we needed it. And if we needed it, other dev teams probably do too.

That's why it's **MIT licensed**, fully documented, and ready to use right now.

Want a WhatsApp button on your WordPress site? Done.
Building a React app? Works there too.
Need it in Google Tag Manager? One custom HTML tag.

No vendor lock-in. No tracking. No BS.

## **Try it in 60 seconds:**

3. Paste it into your HTML
4. Refresh your page

You'll see a beautiful, responsive WhatsApp button. Mobile-optimized. Accessible. Just works.
